# ByteCart ðŸ›’

**ByteCart** is a Django-based e-commerce website developed as the final project for my Django Backend Technologies training course.

This app demonstrates core backend development skills using Django, with an emphasis on structured templates, model relationships, custom views, and clean URL routing. Each chapter builds on the previous, simulating a real-world development process.
